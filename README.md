EVMap Backend [![Build Status](https://github.com/ev-map/backend/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ev-map/backend/actions)
=====

The EVMap backend is a server-side component for the [EVMap app](https://github.com/ev-map/EVMap),
which provides a database of electric vehicle charging stations.
It aggregates data from various open data sources, processes it, and serves it to the app via a REST API.

**This backend is still in an early stage of development and not being used in the current version of EVMap.**
